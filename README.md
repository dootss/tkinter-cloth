# tkinter cloth simulation
cloth simulation using only tkinter because i can
this was mainly made because i wanted a cool cloth simulation i could use on my school computers
plus i like making things using base python modules because i am silly

every single piece of credit for this goes to https://replit.com/@IcemasterEric, because he made simulation.py and the general logic for main.py - i just modified main.py to use tkinter instead lmfao
