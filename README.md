# tkinter cloth simulation
cloth simulation using only tkinter because i can
this was mainly made because i wanted a cool cloth simulation i could use on my school computers
plus i like making things using base python modules because i am silly

every single piece of credit for this goes to https://replit.com/@IcemasterEric, because he made simulation.py and the general logic for main.py, i just modified main.py to use tkinter instead lmfao
download both files, then just run main.py.
check line 62 in simulation.py for configurable values although don't expect it to run smoothly with the size being too high.
